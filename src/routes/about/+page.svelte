            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">McKenney | McClelland PLLC was created on January 1, 2001, from the remaining members of the previous firm McKenney & Jesse, P.C. which was formed in 1987 by Hugh L. McKenney and Joel Lee-Eric Jesse.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In 1999 Joel Jesse left the practice of law in order to pursue a career in business management. Hugh McKenney continued the commercial and general practice as McKenney & Associates, P.C. The offices of McKenney & Jesse, P.C. were located in northwest Houston and remained there in excess of ten (10) years. After the departure of Mr. Jesse, the firm relocated closer to the business district and eventually moved to its present address, still in the northwest Houston area. The firm is currently comprised of three attorneys and maintains a full litigation support staff.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">At its inception, the firm practiced mainly in the area of commercial and business litigation and general business representation. The firm has attracted a number of small, medium and large corporate clients for the handling of all aspects of business representation and business and commercial litigation. The firm's economic basis and legal experience have grown substantially in these areas and since the late 1990s the firm has substantially expanded its property tax appraisal litigation in which it represents all types of property owners in judicial appeals of appraisal district property valuations. At the present time, the majority of the firm's practice revolves around property tax appraisal litigation, general business representation, and commercial litigation, although it continues to handle other matters associated with a general practice.</p>    
            <p class="mb-4">The firm's attorney are licensed to practice in all Texas state courts, including the Texas State Supreme Court, and one or more of the attorneys are licensed to practice in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Hugh McKenney has been qualified to practice in various other state courts.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The attorneys at McKenney | McClelland PLLC are not board certified in any particular area of practice by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.</p>
